# Library Management System
The Library Management System is a Java-based console application designed to help librarians efficiently manage their library's collection of books. <hr/> This simple yet effective system allows librarians to perform various tasks, such as adding new books, displaying the library's catalog, finding books by title, and deleting books by ISBN.

# Features
1. Adding Books
   You can easily add new books to the library's collection by specifying the title, author, ISBN (International Standard Book Number), and the year of publication.

2. Displaying the Catalog
   The program provides an option to display the entire catalog of books in the library. It checks whether the library is empty and, if not, lists all the books with their respective details, including title, author, ISBN, and year of publication.

3. Finding Books by Title
   You can search for books by their titles. The system performs a case-insensitive search and returns the book's details if found. If a book with the specified title is not found, the system indicates so.

4. Deleting Books by ISBN
   The program allows you to remove a book from the library by specifying its ISBN. It first searches for the book with the given ISBN and, if found, deletes it from the catalog. It also provides feedback on whether the deletion was successful or if the book with the specified ISBN was not found.
